libaddr (1.0.11.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Finally broke the class in two: addr and iface.
  * Replaced the is_computer_interface_address() with using the new and
    improved find_addr_interface() so we have additional info, not just
    true/false.
  * Added an is_default() function since that's is true when we setup
    an addr object. That way you can detect an uninitialized addr.
  * Updated the tests accordingly. They still need to to be enhanced to
    cover 100% of the code.
