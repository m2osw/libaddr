libaddr for Debian
------------------

The libaddr fills a need for an actual library to parse IP addresses in C++.
It looks like eveyone is always re-writing this code to parse IP with masks
or ports. Okay, it's relatively easy, but I'm sure a lot of people struggle
with such things and probably never write a test to make sure it works
exactly as expected.
