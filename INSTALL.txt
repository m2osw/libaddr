ABOUT libaddr
=============

The [libaddr](https://snapwebsites.org/project/libaddr)
project is found online on the
[Snap! C++ Websites](https://snapwebsites.org/) website.

That page has some basic documentation and latest information about the
library.


INSTALLING UNDER UBUNTU 16.04+
==============================

Packages are available on launchpad in the
[snapcpp PPA](https://code.launchpad.net/~snapcpp/+archive/ppa/+packages).
You may want to consider using the packages directly instead of attempting
to compile `libaddr` yourself. It should save you a lot of time.

If the packages are not available for your version, check out the
[github source](https://github.com/m2osw/libaddr) instead.

Fixes or improvements are always welcome. All tests should run against
your improvements to prove that they work as expected.


REQUIREMENTS
============

The library requirements are:

* cmake -- the tool to generate the Makefile (no auto-tool or configure!)
* make -- to run the Makefile (whatever version compatible with cmake)
* gcc & g++ -- to compile everything
* gcov & lcov -- to run coverage tests and generate HTML as output
* doxygen -- currently required with the new cmake scheme
* dot (optional) -- recommanded if you want more complete documentations


BUILDING
========

The following are the basic steps once all the necessary requirements were
installed on your system:

    tar xf snapcmakemodules_x.y.z.tar.gz
    tar xf libaddr-x.y.z.tar.gz
    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD
    cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=../snapCMakeModules/Modules ../libaddr
    make
    sudo make install

To install the package exactly where you would like it to be, you will
want to make sure that the cmake tool is called with the correct
installation prefix.


COMMAND LINE TEST
=================

The tests are running using `make` with the `run_libaddr_tests` target.
This will run all the tests. All the tests are currently created inside
one binary file using `catch.cpp`.
