ABOUT libtld
============

The project can be found online at this URI:

  http://snapwebsites.org/project/libtld

That page has some basic documentation and latest information about the
library.


INSTALLING UNDER UBUNTU 12.10+
==============================

Packages are available on launchpad in the snapcpp PPA. You may want to
consider using the packages directly instead of attempting to compile
libtld yourself. It should save you a lot of time.

Check this page for a package you may be able to use:

      https://code.launchpad.net/~snapcpp/+archive/ppa/+packages

If the packages are not available for your version, check out the
source instead. The source can be found in the SourceForge.net
git and you may download various versions from the Files area of
the libtld project.


REQUIREMENTS
============

The library requirements are:

. Qt 4.8+ -- to compile the tld_parser.cpp which generates the tld_data.c file
. boost -- for the C++ code
. doxygen -- currently required with the new cmake scheme
. dot (optional) -- recommanded if you want more complete documentations
. php5-dev -- if you want to create the PHP extension
. cmake -- the tool to generate the Makefile (no auto-tool or configure!)
. make -- to run the Makefile
. gcc & g++ -- to compile everything
. gcov & lcov -- to run coverage tests and generate HTML as output


BUILDING
========

The following are the basic steps one all the necessary requirements were
installed on your system:

  tar xf snapcmakemodules_x.y.z.tar.gz
  tar xf libtld-x.y.z.tar.gz
  mkdir BUILD
  cd BUILD
  cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=../snapCMakeModules/Modules ../libtld
  make
  sudo make install

To install the package exactly where you would like it to be, you will
want to make sure that the cmake tool is called with the correct
installation prefix.


COMMAND LINE TEST
=================

You may test a URI from the command line, once you installed everything
(or from your BUILD directory) using the validate_tld tool as in:

  # Valid test:
  validate_tld http://snapwebsites.org/project/libtld

  # Invalid test:
  validate_tld http://snapwebsites.organization/project/libtld
